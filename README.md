Welcome to the SUPREME graphing calculator, brought to you by representatives from the two greatest sports.
To get started, run the main of GraphingCalculator. This will be the only file the user needs to interact with. You will start off on the main menu, but can cycle from there to the calculations panel. Each panel has a pop-up help screen. INPUTTING NON-NUMBER VALUES WILL GIVE YOU AN ERROR SCREEN WITH AN OPTION TO RETURN TO THE CALCULATOR.
CALCULATIONS
Enter numbers that you wish to perform operations on on opposite sides of an operator. 
for example:
5 + 10
Press the operation button, in this case +, to perform the calculation. The result of this operation will become the input of the other functions automatically, allowing you to string together successive operations. For log and exponent, simply input the information needed to raise an inputted value to a certain power or to find the log of a desired base of a desired number.
GRAPHING
You can cycle from calculations to any function, starting with constant and ending with sextic and hyperbolic. For each function, enter desired coefficients into their appropriate textboxes. It is recommended that you don't use constants of great magnitude, for they will result sometimes in your function being outside of the visible scale.
Press the graph button to view the graph. You can press x to go back to the input frame and graph other functions.
COOL FEATURES
The graph display will tell you:
-what the degree of your function is
-what your function is
-the mininum of your function, with negative infinity as an option
-the maximum of your function, with infinity as an option
-the graph will be an accurate representation of your function, with labeled and numbered x and y axes
COOL FEATURED ADDED SINCE THE DEMO
-graph will tell you accurate y intercept of graph
-graph will tell you accurate turning points of functions, returning none if there are none
-graph accurately scales across different computer types
-closing one graph window doesnt close the program
-improved GUI with better font and organization; easier on the eyes
-functional calculations panel
-help panels
